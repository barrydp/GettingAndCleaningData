The data consists of a number of files conaining data for the body accelation x, y and z dimensions, the body gyro x, y, 
and z dimension and the total acceleration in the x, y, and z dimensions.

Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

There are also files that contain user identification, and activity identification.

The script performs the following operations on the data:
1.  Reads in the relevant files from both the test and train directories
2.  Combine the data into a single data set
3.  Create a new data set that contains only the columns that contain average (mean) and standard deviation data.  To this is added two columns that add he subject and activity data.
4.  The columns are named appropriately.
5.  This data is then saved as a separate file.
