Study design
Taken from the website where the data was obtained:
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person 
performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a 
smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial 
linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded 
to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the 
volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in 
fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which 
has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration 
and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz 
cutoff frequency was used. 

From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and 
tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they 
were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to 
remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals 
(tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals 
(tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated 
using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, 
fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

The data is divided up into two equal sets: training and test.  This implies that it was originally gathered with the 
purpose of training and testing a neural net.

The script performs the following operations on the data:
1. Reads in the relevant files from both the test and train directories
2. Combine the data into a single data set
3. Create a new data set that contains only the columns that contain average (mean) and standard deviation data. To this is added two columns that add he subject and activity data.
4. The columns are named appropriately.
5. This data is then saved as a separate file.
